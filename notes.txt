LSB_Steg.py = rudimentary test of LSB steg technique
SNN_test.py = binary to spike train, multiple layers first test (BUST)
SNN_2.py = binary to spike train, multiple layers, propagation delay considered (BUST)
SNN_3.py = binary to spike train, one layer, loop for changing weights (BUST)
steganography.py = rudimentary steganography with SNN's included, first from ChatGPT (not enough involvement from SNNs)
steganography_multiple_layers_test.py = next step from steganography.py with multiple layers (BUST)
stego_metrics.py = script for metrics for steganography
SNN_4.py = conversion of string to ascii with the idea of injecting ascii value to neuron (similar to ACS Lab 7) (BUST,results in negative ascii values)
SNN_5.py = conversion of string to ascii with the idea of injecting ascii value to neuron (similar to ACS Lab 7) (String has correct characters in wrong order)
SNN_6_encoding_decoding_one_layer.py = WORKING CODE FOR ENCODING AND DECODING TEXT USING 1 SNN LAYER
SNN_7_encoding_decoding_multiple_layers.py = Continuation of SNN_6 with multiple layers
SNN_8_encoding_decoding_multiple_layers.py = uses comparison of spike times from layer1 and layer3 to decode
SNN_9_implementation_into_steg.py = Embed spike data into an image and decode it
